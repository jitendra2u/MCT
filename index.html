  <div class="container">

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3 class="text-center">Who is Medyhne ?</h3>
        <div class="video-wrap"><img alt="" height="" src="img/header/video.png" width="" /></div>
        <div class="who-content text-left">
          <p>My name is Medyhne Lebachen and my goal is to have a abundant and joy-filled existence, doing what I love and helping you to do the same! Interestingly, the root of the name Medyhne -Medha in Sanskrit, means Divine Feminine Sacred Power (I&rsquo;ll take that lol!)</p>
          <p>On my journey I have completed two tertiary qualifications exploring Psychology, Sociology, people and our amazing world! I was then inspired by fitness and became a qualified Aerobics Instructor, achieving super fitness levels! I married, became a mum of three beautiful kids whom I love dearly (and a fourth baby girl who died at birth&hellip; we don&rsquo;t talk often enough about death as being a part of life!) and I am blessed to have come from a lovely family (mum, dad, step-mum- who to their immense credit are all close, and two sisters).</p>
          <p>As every human being does, I have experienced my fair share of trials, tribulations and heartache, such as deaths, divorce and so forth, but I always forged on with an optimistic and pioneering spirit full of hope for the future and can now teach/guide/inspire/inform and pass on some valuable skills I learnt along the way!</p>
          <p>So then, in the scheme of life, my fascination turned to spiritual growth. I trained in numerous Holistic Modalities like Kiniergetics, became a Reiki Master, gained an American qualification as a &lsquo;Minister of Healing&rsquo; and other Healing modalities.</p>
          <p>I have worked extensively in Life Coaching, Healing, Holistic Health, Personal Growth &amp; Development fields (with adults and children) in Schools, Health Practices, Community Centers and Commercial locations &amp; Healing Centres. This included being invited as a Speaker &amp; Contributor at a Victorian Student Representative Group Summit and taking classes at the prestigious &ldquo;The Peninsula School&rdquo; Mt Eliza for final year students in &lsquo;Life Skills and Relaxation&#39; (Stress-Busting Skills!)</p>
          <p>Along the way I have travelled extensively overseas and in Australia including living in a caravan for a while, like a gypsy. I have explored creative interests like pottery, embroidery, doll &amp; rug making, weaving and photography in which I received a place in a tertiary photography competition!</p>
          <p>Creatively, I have written and performed songs seemingly forever(!), singing solo on national television, scoring an International Song Publishing Deal in 10 countries, having a song (with Graham Oxford from our band Sonic Remedy) in a US movie, recording and selling my CD&rsquo;s, recording my song with a beautiful School Choir, and having an International film company shoot a video for my song (virtually the only sad one in my collection lol!!) &ldquo;Sun Don&rsquo;t Shine Today&rdquo;.</p>
          <p>I loved presenting my two popular community radio shows (including co-hosting a live Anzac Day Parade in Cranbourne of over 9,000 people &amp; interviewing number one Australian country music artist for many years, Graeme Connors.</p>
          <p>In the writing department (no pun intended!), I am a relatively prolific Published author, with six books being released within the next year. My book &ldquo;Hilhairyass Poems&rdquo; is a fun collection of 41 poems about all aspects of life aimed at 9 year olds and upwards. There is a 10 track playful CD available that enhances 10 of the poems, sold separately. The illustrations are by top Australian illustrator &amp; artist Mark Payne (who was illustrator in the number one Penguin series of books &ldquo;Aussie Bites&rdquo;) and I chortled and chatted with radio and print media, up the Eastern border of Australia, in a promotional tour, when it was released. Articles of mine have been published also in National magazines like &ldquo;Living Now&rdquo;.</p>
          <p>For many years I have sold paintings and have illustrated my book &ldquo;GODDESS Maidens Of Medyhne&rdquo;. My prints are now available here online. As are the stunning prints by Rosa, a Taiwanese artist.</p>
          <p>On the personal level, I have had grand love in my life, beautiful friendships and met some great people! I have tried at all times to embody the virtues of compassion and kindness (while being human at the same time and working on my own growth lol!) with the intention of leaving a positive and helpful footprint, on the Earth we share.</p>
          <p>I love animals and brought home a duck, a tortoise and some stray dogs when I was a child (among other things!).</p>
          <p>Horse riding was a passion and I was unjustifiably proud to receive a third placing in a gymkhana when all, bar two, of the entrants bolted from the ring! I have swum with dolphins, held two baby lion cubs (at once!) and wild pythons in Byron Bay, had a migration of blue spotted butterflies flying overhead for hours, and unforgettably, been surrounded by a pod of killer whales off the Bay Of Islands, New Zealand, while on a boat trip. I have eaten the world&rsquo;s best ice cream (arguably!) in Florence, climbed Mt Sinai (dodging tear gas!), seen Pompei, the Statue Of David and Tutankamen&rsquo;s Tomb. I danced in &lsquo;The Sound of Music&rdquo; Gazebo in Vienna, Austria, had a lead role in an Amateur Theatre production, scored a bit-part speaking role in Vince Colosimo&rsquo;s first movie, and was nanny to a poodle in Paris. Heck, a Shiekh in Egypt even offered to buy me for quite a few camels (gulp&hellip;my response was &ldquo;No thanks!&rdquo;)</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I have known Medyhne, this lovely lady, for many years now. I&#39;m so blessed we crossed paths.</p>
            <p>I have had many healings from Medyhne, also distantly, as well. Medyhne has helped me to move forward in my journey emotionally, spiritually, physically.</p>
            <p>Medyhne&rsquo;s caring passion and her love for others has touched so many people&#39;s lives. Thank you so much for being who you are.</p>
            <span class="pink-text">Christina, God bless XX&rdquo;</span>
            <p>&ldquo;I just want to say thank you so much for teaching me meditation and life coaching over the last few months. Thank you for your kindness, your honesty and your wisdom.</p>
            <p>You are such a wonderful person with a unique gift that I hope you will continue to share with people. You have helped me so much much more than counsellors, psychiatrists and psychologists combined.</p>
            <p>You teach people how to love, most importantly how to love themselves and although I&rsquo;m not there yet, I am definitely on the way&hellip;I wish you all the love, hope and best in the world.</p>
            <p>Don&rsquo;t change and keep smiling! Love Always Bree &ldquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for everything you have taught me over the last few months. I&rsquo;m feeling the best I have in a long time and couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you.</p>
            <p>You&rsquo;re a wonderful person and it&rsquo;s been a pleasure knowing you. I wish you every happiness in life. Take care Luv Kristy&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Medyhne is very dedicated and compassionately mindful in her care. I highly recommend her and hope her gifts and abilities continue to reach further into the world.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&quot;I love this book.</p>
            <p>I can actually say it is hard to put down and go to sleep.</p>
            <p>I want to pass it around to all my friends.</p>
            <p>You have done it.</p>

            <p>&quot;I have a passion for nonsensical rhyme especially &#39;Hilhairyass Poems&#39; - it&#39;s one of the most profound books of this genre that I have read in a long time because it appeals to all age groups and inspires on many different levels.&quot;</p>
            <span class="pink-text">Leanne Barker</span>
            <p>&quot;One of the greatest fears I see in the world today is the fear of self-expression. This book is an essential tool to help</p>
            <p>alleviate this fear in the world by helping the children of today express themselves and learn about the weird world of emotion.&quot;</p>
            <span class="pink-text">Bren Hill</span>
            <p>&ldquo;I absolutely love your book. It really think it&rsquo;s fantastic.&rdquo;</p>
            <span class="pink-text">Gavin Johns</span>
            <p>&quot;Anything we can do to assist children to discover and express the full range of their emotions and build their capacity for emotional understanding and wellbeing is a great thing. Medyhne Lebachen&#39;s book makes the world of feelings equally natural, colourful and engaging and provides parents and teachers with an invaluable resource to share with children. Reading is a powerful means by which to engage with children, make a safe space to explore and share feelings, and lay a path of education AND connection that can last a lifetime.</p>
            <p>It&#39;s a lovely, bright bonus that Lebachen&#39;s book makes emotions such a natural and normal part of a child&#39;s development and indeed being! The world would be a kinder place if we all developed a healthy capacity for emotional expression when we were children&quot;.</p>
            <p>Heather Yelland, Director Green SuperCamp Australia Winner, Most Trusted Australian Business Leader, Australian Trust Awards 2015</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I presided at a book launch on Friday 2 November. The book is known as &lsquo;Hilarious&rsquo; (Hilhairyass) Poems &ndash; I have deliberately mispronounced the title to be polite &ndash;</p>
            <span class="pink-text">&ldquo;Hilarious&rdquo; Poems by Medyhne Lebachen.</span>
            <p>I attended on invitation and was asked to speak at the book launch. The book was published by a publishing house, the principal of which lives in Hepburn Springs, so it&rsquo;s very much a local production; testimony of what we in Hepburn Shire can do. As I read through a book provided to me on the night and listened to Medyhne read a few of her poems, I realised that here we have amongst us a female Dr Suess and how much I would have loved reading Medyhne&rsquo;s poems when I was going to secondary school and doing a Dead Poets&rsquo; Society way back then.</p>
            <p>I would commend Medhyne, indeed, for her book. I purchased a number of copies. Medyhne has signed them &ndash; this one is written out to Hepburn Shire Council &lsquo;Enjoy &ndash; Medyhne Lebachen&rsquo;. I understand Mr CEO when the stress gets too much, this is the book to give to the stressed out staff member or Councillor and I am sure it will prove to be worth its weight in gold.&rdquo;</p>
            <span class="pink-text">MAYOR&rsquo;S REPORT Councillor &amp; Mayor, Bill McClenaghan, Holcombe Ward</span>
            <p>&ldquo;This (or Ms. Lebachen&rsquo;s) expressive collection of poems made me laugh and made me cry because it made me aware of how the things we think are important prevent us from seeing the little things that really matter and that could change how we perceive and treat ourselves and other people.&rdquo;</p>
            <span class="pink-text">Simon Berdell Cicak</span>
            <p>&quot; &#39;Hilhairyass Poems&#39;, well what can I say!? Hilhairyass Poems has everything! It has such character and value that reach out to its audience with a message to all people that being who you are is beautiful and unique and to put any situation as an adult or child into a silly perspective. The illustrations capture Medyhne&#39;s poetry perfectly and is an absolute enjoyable read. Full of wit and humour for all ages and is a must-have for children and adults everywhere!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I was delighted with the changes in my son trough his work with Medyhne. She worked at a deep emotional level, yet managed to make the sessions playful and fun. She was compassionate and helpful in showing me ways to further the work at home.&rdquo;</p>
            <span class="pink-text">Cherie Bridges</span>
            <p>&ldquo;Medyhne inspires you to look inside yourself and to help yourself deal with things. She makes you stronger and she helps you to find inner peace and inner strength. She gives you the skills to understand yourself and like who you are.&rdquo;</p>
            <span class="pink-text">Stephanie, 13 yrs</span>
            <p>&ldquo;My daughter had experienced a very difficult childhood and Medyhne did ten sessions with her. After this time her behaviour transformed she became much less reserved, joined the Choir and played tennis. This was the first time she had chosen to do these type of things.</p>
            <p>She was and is so much happier. I am deeply grateful for this work and encourage others to book in NOW! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.&rdquo;</p>

      <div class="modal-body"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </div>
